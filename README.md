1. Read the instructions
2. Create a Next.js project with its CLI and required configurations
3. Created required pages
4. Apply business logic. All pages are with 'use client'
5. Use zustand instead of redux-toolkit, becuase it might be time taken
6. Make responsive from mobile to desktop screen using tailwind CSS.
